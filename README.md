## Project Overview

This project focuses on segmentation using **Clustering** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** as part of the Data Mining course. The datasets collected contain many variables, which makes it challenging to extract useful insights without applying Data Science techniques. The first step is to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand the data, followed by:

1. **Digital Marketing Advertisement Data Segmentation** using clustering techniques.
2. **Identifying Optimum Principal Components** that explain the most variance in the **Primary Census Data** using PCA.

## Datasets Used

- **Clustering Clean Ads_Data-2**: Digital marketing advertisement data used for segmentation using clustering techniques.
- **PCA India Data_Census**: Primary Census data used for PCA analysis to identify the most significant components.
